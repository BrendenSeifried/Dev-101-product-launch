        Here is a picture of a tree. It's in black and white.
        Some people would interpret that as art. I wouldn't know because I'm not artistic at all but I figured that 
        I would include this image to make it seem like I know what I'm doing. My lack of vision is made apparent
        by the Atrocious page layout.
